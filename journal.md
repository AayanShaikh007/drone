# July 30th- Spent 7 hours designing the frame of the drone. 

After working on the drone for a while, it is finally starting to look like what I wanted the final product to look like. I have made it into a modular design- the arms individually screw into the body but lock into place using the other arms as support. This should hopefully result in a pretty solid but repairable body design. Other than that, I also made the flight controller/ power distribution board holder body in the center. Next, I will edit the frame a little more to add support to the frame arms.
